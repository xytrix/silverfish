How to install:

(- make a copy of the original defaultroutine-folder (but don save it in routines folder))

- delete the DefaultRoutine folder in Hearthbuddy/Routines

- extract the stuff inside the DefaultRoutine_nH.zip to that Hearthbuddy/Routines folder
  (if you did it correctly you will have a Hearthbuddy/Routines/DefaultRoutine/Silverfish - folder)
